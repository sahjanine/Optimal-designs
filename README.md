These algorithms were developed in my Master's thesis to obtain optimal designs, considering criterion D, with fractional polynomials as non-linear functions. The method used is the coordinate exchange algorithm, which has been adapted from da Silva, Gilmour and Trinca (2017) to fractional polynomial models. It takes
the following inputs: the number of factors k, the design size n, the number of tries nTries,
the polynomial degree m, the set of candidate levels of the factors cand, the vector of parameters α and β (for locally optimal designs) or prior probability distributions for α and
β (for pseudo-Bayesian optimal designs).
